Demoscene Lab
=============

Playing around with code and evolutionary design hoping to create a demo and learning/blogging about various demoscene magical things.

[Here](http://blog.scene.ro) you should find a series of blog posts that accompany this code.

Requirements:

- C++11 compiler
- SDL2 development library
- OpenGL development libraries
- OpenGL 2.1 enabled computer

### SDL2 development library

Installing on debian based systems (Debian/Ubuntu/ElementaryOS/etc):
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

Installing on OSX with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
```
brew install sdl2
```

For other systems try your luck here: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

### Compiling and running

Just run `make` with the proper `Makefile`
