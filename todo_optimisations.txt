Possible optimizations
======================

- reduce bool sizes e.g bool isOpaque : 1;
- use dietlibc or ulibc
- compress material flags into an int
- shader based texture generator?
- glsl minifier on shader sources, preprocess step that generates minified source
- optimize mesh generation (grid and cylinder can be mixed. possibly cone too)
- get rid of smart pointers, get rid of deallocations, not nice but no point in wasting code space on dealloc 
- ForceField's getFieldValueAt(const glm::vec3& position) and getFieldNormalAt(const glm::vec3& position) could be joined in order to save precious code space
- MarchingCube's calculateIntersectionVertices could be implemented in a procedural fashion instead of unrolled loop
- MarchingCube: switch to alternative (shorter) table, that should save some size.

- add glm as git submodule from https://github.com/g-truc/glm instead of relying on the system provided package
