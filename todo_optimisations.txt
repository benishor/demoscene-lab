Possible optimizations
======================

- reduce bool sizes e.g bool isOpaque : 1;
- use dietlibc or ulibc
- compress material flags into an int
- shader based texture generator?
- glsl minifier on shader sources, preprocess step that generates minified source
- optimize mesh generation (grid and cylinder can be mixed. possibly cone too)
- get rid of smart pointers, get rid of deallocations, not nice but no point in wasting code space on dealloc
